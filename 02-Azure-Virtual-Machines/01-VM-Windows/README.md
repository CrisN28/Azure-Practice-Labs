# Exercise 01 - Create and Deploy a Virtual Machine

## Objectives - Exercise 01:

- Deploy a virtual machine using the ARM template.
- Create a parameter template to deploy the virtual machine.

<br>

# Exercise 02 - Create a Public IP Address, a Network Security Group, and Associate Them with the Virtual Machine
 
## Objectives - Exercise 02:

- Set up a dynamic public IP address and link it to the virtual machineâ€™s network interface.
- Configure a Network Security Group (NSG) with rules that allow RDP access (port 3389) for the virtual machine.

<br>

## Learning Outcomes:

- Developed expertise in linking public IPs and NSGs to NICs to create secure connections.
- Understood the process of associating public IPs and network security groups (NSGs) with network interfaces (NICs).
- Developed well-organized and efficient scripts for Azure resource management.
- Practiced using commands to audit configurations and validate security rules.


## Templates and Scripts Used:

- [ARM Template for the Virtual Machine](./01-vm-deployment-template.json)
- [Parameters Template for Virtual Machine](./02-parameters-vm.json)
- [PowerShell Scripts to Deploy the Virtual Machine](./03-deploy-vm.ps1)

- [ARM Template for Public IP, NSG, and RDP Rule Association](./04-ip-nsg-rdp-associate-template.json)
- [PowerShell Script to Attach Public IP and NSG to the VM](./05-deploy-associate-ip-nsg.ps1)

- [PowerShell Script to Verify Public IP and NSG Configuration](./06-verifyIP-NSG.ps1)

## Additional notes:

>[!IMPORTANT]
>- Pre-existing network and subnet: The virtual network (Labs-Network) and the subnet (Subnet01) were set up in a prior exercise and are used in this one.

>[!CAUTION]
>- Security best practices: RDP access rules should never allow universal access in production setups, as this opens the system to critical security threats.
