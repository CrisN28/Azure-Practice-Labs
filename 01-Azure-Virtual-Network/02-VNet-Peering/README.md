# Exercise 01 - Creating a virtual network with two subnets

## Objectives:

- Use an existing resource group for network deployment
- Deploy a virtual network `Labs-Network02` with a /16 address space
- Define subnet configurations with specific address prefixes (SubnetA and SubnetB)

<br>

# Exercise 02 - Creating Virtual Network Peering

## Objectives:

- Retrieve two existing virtual networks using `Get-AzVirtualNetwork`
- Establish peering from `Labs-Network` to `Labs-Network02` to allow traffic between them
- Establish reverse peering from `Labs-Network02` to `Labs-Network`
- Practice using `Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering` to configure bidirectional communication

<br>

## Learning Outcomes:

- Learn how to reuse an existing resource group for deploying network infrastructure
- Learn how to define address spaces and create a virtual network with two subnets using PowerShell
- Implement bidirectional peering between VNets and manage traffic flow
- Learn to retrieve resource properties (such as `.Id`) via `Get-AzVirtualNetwork`
- Identify and prevent IP address range overlaps between networks to ensure proper connectivity

## Scripts Used:

1- [Deploy a VNet with two subnets using PowerShell](./01-VNet-Subnets-Deploy.ps1)  
2- [PowerShell script to set up virtual network peering](./02-VNet-Peering-Setup.ps1)

## Additional notes:

>[!NOTE]
> Remember to remove the virtual network peering before deleting the VNets to avoid dependency errors.

>[!TIP]
> To monitor and validate connectivity, enable Azure Network Watcher in EastUS and use the Connection Monitor without needing VMs.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This exercise was built using an existing resource group, virtual network and subnets.                                

>[!CAUTION]
> Do not assign overlapping IP address ranges between VNets; otherwise, peering will fail or connectivity may be inconsistent.
