# Private Blob Container Deployment in Azure  

This exercise focuses on **creating a private blob container** in Azure using an ARM template      
Additionally, the exercise includes:  

- **Generating a SAS token** to enable controlled access to the private container
- **Uploading a blob (image) using the SAS token**, demonstrating secure data transfer in Azure Storage

# Exercise 01 - Create a private blob container using ARM

## Objectives - Exercise 01:

- Deploy a **private blob container** in Azure using an ARM template with restricted access   
- Automate deployment using Infrastructure-as-Code principles with ARM templates  
- Configure restricted access to ensure security

<br>

# Exercise 02 - Generate a SAS Token and Upload an Image 

## Objectives - Exercise 02:

- Generate a **SAS token** to allow controlled access to a private container  
- Securely upload an **image** (blob) to the storage account using SAS authentication    
- Apply security and access control best practices in Azure Storage   

<br>

## Learning Outcomes:

- Understand the fundamentals of deploying a private blob container using ARM templates.      
- Learn how to generate and utilize a **SAS token** for controlled access to private storage.
- Execute secure data transfers by uploading a **blob (image) using SAS authentication**.    
- Learn how to effectively implement **Azure Storage access policies** while safeguarding critical data and resources.
